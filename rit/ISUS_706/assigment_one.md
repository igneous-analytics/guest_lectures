================

Now that you are familiar with R Markdown, the first exercise is to
author an R markdown document that narriates the exploratory data
analysis(EDA) of a dataset of your choice. The domain of the data should
be related to sustainability and can be recycled from a previous course.

The document should include:  
\* a description of the data  
\* a table of data w/ pagination (the ability to split the data into
individual pages)  
\* at least two graphs that support ideas in the text  
\* proper titles and axis labels  
\* text that supports a linear narrative ~ beginning with an
introduction to the data and concluding with a summary of your findings.

Note: Assigment two will *likely* expand upon this EDA. You will be
asked to perform a regression analysis on a variate/covariate
combination of your choice.

Should you have any question, you can e-mail me: **frankgalushajr** ‘at’
symbol google’s mail service.
